; hello🐻

; i'm kontio / ki, or literally any word for bear,, he/him pronouns for the non fins

; i like finnish history, war movies, tuntematon sotilas♡, finnish war novels, kalevala ( finnish mythology ), pagan religions, and a bunch of games such as Rdr2, CoD, KcD2 and Runo

; i'm friendly if you are, might be a bit quiet / awkward at first tho. any type of interaction is appreciated! i do like making new buddies :) i may be quiet sometimes, but it's only because I can't think of anything to say, it's most likely not your fault.
